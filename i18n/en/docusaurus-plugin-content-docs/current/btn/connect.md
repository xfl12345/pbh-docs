# Connect to BTN

 To participate in the BTN program, you just need to connect the BTN client to the BTN server. This article uses PeerBanHelper as the BTN client and Sparkle as the BTN server for demonstration.

## Sparkle

Sparkle is the official BTN server of PBH-BTN.

### Register an account, create UserApp

Open the browser [https://btn-prod.ghostchu-services.top](https://btn-prod.ghostchu-services.top) and log in with GitHub authorization, an account will be automatically created.

Click on the "User Applications" link in the top menu to go to the management page.
